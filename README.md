What is this?
This project is a DCS lua mission repo, containing a lot of the main code that goes into the Vietstan DCS missions. 
The specific elements of the mission, at least from a coding point of view, are all in the relevant Lua folder and each has its own sub directory.
This file is then called down from CYC_do.lua if it is run from the F10 map in game. The code for each small bit that makes up Vietstan should be designed to work stand alone so it can be ported across to other missions.

Why?
It is useful as a shared repo of code for the people that work on the Vietstan missions, or for those that want to steal(feel free) the code and files for smaller aspects of the missions.
Such as the carrier scripts, AAA scripts etc 

Getting started?
Copy the missions and folder structure and run them in DCS, open the missions up in an editor like 7zip to see the structure and the relevant code. The folders in this github, with Lua or sounds are where that code is pulled from but the actual working stuff is in the .miz files. Lots of useful documentation for this can be found on the hoggit scripting wiki as this is all basically running MIST.

Help with the script?
There isn't really any help, if you want to steal stuff from this for your own missions go for it and google stuff like everyone else, however at least at the time of creation an active discord community of mission makers and a lot of others work has also gone into this. We discuss and help people willing to contribute and join in to this community so feel free to chat there we'll be willing to welcome you to our Lua mines look for DCS Refugees on wingman finder, hoggit etc.

Main contributors the DCS refugees Lua mine workers.
